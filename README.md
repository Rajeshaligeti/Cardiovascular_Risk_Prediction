  About the project

- Implemented Logistic Regression for CHD prediction.
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Visualized model performance metrics with bar plots.
- Saved the best model for future use.
